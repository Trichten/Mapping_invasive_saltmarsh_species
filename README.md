# Mapping_invasive_saltmarsh_species
In this project, we work with a new dataset of UAS-based images from a saltmarsh area in Hallig Nordstrandischmoor which is in northern germany to supplement an existing project. In the existing project, the suitability of drone-based methods for mapping the invasive saltmarsh species Elymus athericus was evaluated. Now, two years later, we use a UAS-aquired dataset with the same properties to perform a change detection and also repeat the previous study in order to see if the same values of accuracy can be achieved with data from a different point in time and therefore learn more about the robustness of the applied method.
